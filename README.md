SnkrsCarousel is an MVVM application with caching persistence in a local database with Flow and Room. Instead of going the traditional route of leveraging the ViewPager class in order to build a carousel, I wanted to see how it would be done if I built my own ViewPager with an infinite loop in Jetpack Compose with a focus on creating custom animations with the Compose Animation API.
