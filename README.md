![](demo.gif)

Snkrs Carousel is an MVVM application with caching persistence in a local database with Flow and Room. Instead of going the traditional route of leveraging the ViewPager class in order to build a carousel, I wanted to see how it would be done if I built my own ViewPager with an infinite loop in Jetpack Compose with a focus on creating custom animations with the Compose Animation API.


- Compose
- MAD (Modern Architecture Development)
- Retrofit
- Hilt
- Moshi
- Coroutines/Flow
- Accompanist Coil (Image Loading)
- Custom Pagination based off ViewPager/[Pager](https://google.github.io/accompanist/pager/) in Compose
- Custom Transition & Display Animations
- LeakCanary
- The Sneaker Database Api (RapidApi)

Created with Jetpack Compose and built in 2020.3.1 Android Studio Arctic Fox.
